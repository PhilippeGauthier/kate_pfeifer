					<h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
					<p>I think of therapy as a collaborative problem-solving process and with each new client I am challenged to determine how I can be most helpful in that process. I meet the client where he or she is at and provide a safe, nurturing place to express difficult emotions and discuss difficult subjects. Clients find me warm, engaging and deeply attuned to their needs and fears.</p>
					<p>I enjoy working with individuals facing all kinds of life issues including depression, anxiety, problems in the workplace, substance abuse, trauma, grief and loss, LGBTQ issues, living with chronic pain, terminal illness, adoption, fertility issues, phase of life and aging issues, and relationship problems of all sorts.  I have experience working with individuals with severe mental illness including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder, among others.</p>
					<p>My work is integrative in nature and is informed by several theoretical approaches including attachment theory, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Brief Solution-Focused Therapy, Narrative Therapy, mindfulness techniques and Bowen Family Systems. However, I also draw from other approaches on a case by case basis. I conceptualize of most situations through an attachment theory lens. I aim to be there for my clients in the most helpful way possible given the unique circumstances of their particular situation.</p>

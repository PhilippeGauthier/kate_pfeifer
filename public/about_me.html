					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>As a bit of background about myself, I was born and raised in Texas and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2001 with a dual degree in Psychology and Plan II Honors with a Minor in Spanish Literature.  I went on to Columbia Law School where I received a J.D. in 2005.  I then practiced law for five years before returning to graduate school, yet again, to pursue my passion for helping others by becoming a psychotherapist.</p>
					<p>I completed my Marriage and Family Therapy graduate coursework and received my Master's from the University of San Diego and have since practiced in San Diego, Santa Clara and now the San Francisco Bay Area.  I have clinical experience in several settings which include a primary medical care practice, an elementary school and as an intern in private practice.</p>
					<p>I feel that it is a privilege to be a therapist.  I am always learning from my clients and am deeply committed to helping them improve and achieve their goals. I am fully present in session giving my client my undivided attention and concentration. Clients report that I am perceptive and insightful, that I have a way of making them feel comfortable and that my therapy room is a safe and nonjudgmental place to express themselves. These are among the highest compliments I could receive.</p>

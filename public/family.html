					<h2>Family Therapy</h2>
					<p>I have helped parents and children working with issues such as academic difficulties, ADHD, emotional regulation, social skills, oppositional and defiant behavior, physical aggression, depression, anxiety, phobias, grief and loss, parenting challenges, blended families, divorce and other transitions in the family mileu including new siblings, adoption and extended family issues.  I also have experience working with adolescents struggling with depression and engaging in self-harming behaviors and substance abuse.</p>
					<p>I take a very collaborative approach when working with families.  I see the family from a systemic framework and believe that the functioning of each member of the family has an impact on all of the other members of the family, however that “family” is defined or perceived.  I aim to make sure that each family member’s voice is heard and perspective taken into consideration in our work together.  I enjoy working with multicultural and interfaith families and families that defy traditional gender norms and structures.</p>
					<p>When working with children, I use techniques from play therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy and integrate mindfulness components wherever possible.  Depending on the age of the child and the circumstances that bring them to see me, we might play with puppets, do craft projects or just talk.  I have experience working with children with ADD/ADHD, developmental delays, autism spectrum disorders, siblings of children with special needs, and adolescents.</p>
